The architectural shortcoming of blockchain allows either scalability or security but we have achieved both with our zero-chain technology that allows both scalabilitye and security.</span></p><p><strong>SIMPLICITY<br></strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Achieve maximum performance from IT infrastructure by making everything extremely simple. Distibuted Zero Robots wih a single core function and nothing more than that one core function.</span></p><p><strong>SCALABILITY &amp; SECURITY<br></strong><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Zero Robots managing operational and financial transactions on the grid peer-to-peer with a stateless operating system create an infinitely scalable platform.
