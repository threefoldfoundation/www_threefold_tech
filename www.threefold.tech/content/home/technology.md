A versatile blockchain technology implemented on the TF Grid to manage all financial transactions and authoritative identity information (Zero Chain) for all Zero Bots. The Zero Bots use a different, private implementation of this PoS blockchain to store all state information of all tasks they are  managing. There will literally be millions of blockchains running on the TF Grid."
