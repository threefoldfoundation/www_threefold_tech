The internet architectural shortcoming of blockchain allows either scalability or security but we have achieved both with our zero-chain technology that allows a proof of stake blockchain that is both scalable and secure."

A versatile blockchain technology implemented on the TG Grid to amnage all financial transactions and authoritative identity information (Zero Chain) for all Zero Bots. The Zero Bots use a different, private implementation of this PoS blockchain to store all state information of all tasks it is  managin. There will literally be millions of blockchains running on the TF Grid."
